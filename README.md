## Introduction

The Book Recommender System is designed to provide personalized book recommendations by analyzing user behavior and preferences. It uses collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid approaches to suggest books that align with users' tastes. This project can be a helpful tool for book enthusiasts looking for new reads or for developers interested in exploring recommendation system models.

## Features

- **User-Based Recommendations**: Suggests books based on similar user preferences.
- **Content-Based Recommendations**: Uses book metadata like genre, author, and description for personalized suggestions.
- **Hybrid Model**: Combines collaborative and content-based filtering to improve recommendation quality.
- **Data Visualization**: Presents insights on book ratings, popularity, and genre distribution.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `numpy` for numerical computations
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning algorithms
  - `NLTK` for natural language processing
- **Data Sources**: Public book datasets such as Book-Crossing or Goodreads data.

## Installation
